" December 1, 2022",Reviewed in the United States ,Meg,"Pretty good value, minor grievances","Phone arrived in a generic box but was well packaged. I do feel that for the product I received, the claim of ‚Äúthe screen and body show no signs of cosmetic damage visible from 12 inches away"" is being stretched a bit. There is damage on the bottom and right sides of the body of the phone where the paint has been chipped off. I don‚Äôt particularly mind these as much, because I will be putting a case on the phone, but it is worth mentioning. My major gripe with the phone I received is the scratch in the screen that you can very clearly see when it‚Äôs turned on. It‚Äôs a bit disappointing.. I have no complaints with the functionality of the device. It has 89% battery health, which could definitely be better, but it‚Äôs alright. It came unlocked, with the amount of storage I paid for, 256gb. Camera, speakers, etc. all seem to be in great working order. I needed a replacement after my 1st gen SE died on me, and this one is a great upgrade.",4.0 out of 5 stars,https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-SE-128GB-Red/dp/B088NKTHQW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"Apple iPhone SE (2nd Generation), US Version, 128GB, Red - Unlocked (Renewed)"
" October 27, 2022",Reviewed in the United States ,Tangero,"Great phone, even in 2022","I love the light weight and smaller form factor compared to most modern phones. Setup was easy, switching from Android was not difficult. Mine arrived with 93% battery health, quite good for an older device, though the device also arrived without any charge at all, so don‚Äôt plan to use it immediately. The speaker is not good and drains your battery quite substantially. The device physically shakes at high volumes; this phone is best used with headphones for music and video consumption. The device is fast, the screen is quite crisp, and the fingerprint reader is very reliable. The device also came with very little bloatware, and unlike with Android, you can uninstall almost everything rather than just disabling the apps.. My impression of the phone is quite favorable, though some of Apple‚Äôs choices with their software are just a bit silly. The settings for some apps aren‚Äôt as granular as they are on Android. If you don‚Äôt wholly live in Apple‚Äôs ecosystem and consume technology exactly as they think you should, there will be a bit of a learning curve. That‚Äôs more an issue with the current status of the software across all Apple devices than an issue with this phone specifically and there are ways to adapt to and work around it.",4.0 out of 5 stars,https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-SE-128GB-Red/dp/B088NKTHQW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"Apple iPhone SE (2nd Generation), US Version, 128GB, Red - Unlocked (Renewed)"
" September 9, 2021",Reviewed in the United States ,MatthewX,Perfect phone for someone like me.,"I previously purchased from Amazon Renewed an iPhone 5s, and was satisfied with it considering the price was barely over one hundred dollars. That phone, however, was originally released in 2013, and at 8 years old it was getting hard to justify its continued use.. So when the new iPhone SE (2020) was released I was really tempted to get it, but the pandemic had basically stopped any purchasing of anything for me at the time. Now in September of 2021, with the battery in my old phone failing, it was time to do something.. I decided to check out what Amazon might have in their ""renewed"" products and was surprised to find that they now have ""Renewed Premium"", which offers a year's satisfaction guarantee. That meant, in my mind, I could send this thing back if it wasn't good or turned out to be a lemon, so I sprung for it.. First of all, this one came in a nice box, oversized, and obviously sturdy enough to protect everything inside. It comes with an information packet describing what ""premium"" means, along with a quick start guide. The inclusion of a standard wall charger was nice, but I have a number of chargers already, not to mention my iPad Pro charger. I'll get back to that in a minute.. Another thing that was nice to have included was a tool for removing the SIM card tray. Nice, but it turns out that with the new iPhone SE you can use eSIM! More on that as well in a minute.. Now first of all... This phone looks gorgeous. The red color and the black front make for an awesome combination. All surfaces are smooth as if it was a brand new phone. Turning it on shows the screen is working perfectly, with even back lighting all across to each corner.. The first thing I checked was the ""battery health"". Amazon promises that with their renewed premium phones the battery would at least be at ninety percent of capacity, so I immediately checked.. Ninety-eight percent! Eight percent better than what they promised. Not bad at all!. So it turns out that this phone supports fast charging. So that means my phone gets charged on the desk where my iPad Pro sits, because the charger for that is a high capacity charger. The iPhone SE charges up easily in a little over an hour, which means no need to plug it in over night. In fact, I plug it in before bed, but it's plugged into an outlet controlled by Alexa and that wont come on till in the morning. The phone charges up to capacity before I go to work!. Now for setting up the service, the iPhone SE (2020) supports eSIM, which means getting set up with Mint Mobile (or any service that supports eSIM) was as easy as... Well, I went to Mint Mobile's website, checked my location, checked phone compatibility, chose my service plan, then chose eSIM at check out. A few minutes later a QR code appeared on the screen of my computer that I scanned with the iPhone SE, and a few seconds later I had 4G/LTE and everything ready to go.. eSIM is the way to go. It is, just trust me on that.. After about a week of using the phone, on some days like I normally do and on other day literally trying to cause it run dry of battery or trying to get it to malfunction, this little phone is holding up way better than I could have anticipated. I believe I can safely say my iPhone 5s can be retired for good.. By the way. Get a cover. This phone has a glass back, which means it can be charged wirelessly, but it also means you can break it easily. I got a simple transparent back cover with a raised bezel around the edges. It cost about 9 dollars, came in the same day as the phone.. I would recommend this phone and the Amazon Renewed Premium program. Yes the cost of the phone was more than it would have been with renewed only, but being able to return the phone for up to a year is worth it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-SE-128GB-Red/dp/B088NKTHQW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"Apple iPhone SE (2nd Generation), US Version, 128GB, Red - Unlocked (Renewed)"
" November 11, 2022",Reviewed in the United States ,Justin,"Phone works, customer service was responsive in a timely manner",The phone (refurbished) seems to be working fine. It‚Äôs only been a few weeks but so far so good. My only issue was I ordered a 256 & received a 128 mb. I have the two TB in the cloud but you still can‚Äôt really do as much once ur phone or tablet is full so this was important to me but the company offered me a full refund if I wanted to ship back or a partial refund to keep the latter. I opted for that because I didn‚Äôt feel like waiting and setting everything up again. They issued me the partial refund I selected within hours. No 5-7 business days nonsense so I‚Äôd recommend this company Joygoods and their commitment to responsiveness if shopping for a refurbished iPhone or the like. The model doesn‚Äôt come with face recognition but the home button works for fingerprint print unlike many refurbs (particularly in this price range) so yeah they were solid. The battery health was also at 93% which is stellar for a refurbished phone. üëäüèº‚ù§Ô∏èüëç,5.0 out of 5 stars,https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-SE-128GB-Red/dp/B088NKTHQW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"Apple iPhone SE (2nd Generation), US Version, 128GB, Red - Unlocked (Renewed)"
" November 30, 2022",Reviewed in the United States ,Oscar,What should you expect?,"Received and opened. Had a roughed and scratch portion on the top right side of the screen, so much so that the screen protector didn‚Äôt adhere to this part of the screen. Noticeable as a bubble on the screen. I‚Äôm pretty sure I bought the premium one promising, little to no cosmetic damage. Bought it for my friend who needed to replace her phone.

" December 1, 2022",Reviewed in the United States ,Kaitlyn Brown,It is is good and I am happy to have a phone but‚Ä¶,I am happy but it has the minimum battery life listed which is what they stated could happen‚Ä¶ Different buying options have different battery life ranges and I got the lowest end of my range but it is okay!

" November 30, 2022",Reviewed in the United States ,Spudly,already giving me issues 3 days into owning it,"NOTE: I purchased this as a ""renewed"" product by Amazon. I've mostly purchased renewed phones off of eBay, but I've burned before by waiting a week or two, giving a positive review, then the item crapping out on me soon after so I thought I'd give Amazon's refurbished product a try since you have 90 days of guaranteed satisfaction and you can always come back to edit your reviews.. MY ISSUES THUS FAR (3 days into ownership): Essentially, the phone is *not* fully functional.. 1. I'm already dealing with multiple app crashes. I'd like to blame it on the app alone, but the last refurbished iphone SE (original) that I owned started doing this with a single app which progressed into multiple apps crashing on me. That phone has only lasted a few months. Now, I'm not entirely sure if this is a refurbished phone issue or an iphone SE issue, but I know that the new iphone SE I originally purchased directly from the store didn't do this to me until the end of it's lifespan.. 2. Rings are not reliably coming through which has already resulted in a couple of missed calls. I work from home so I cannot be missing these calls from my office. Sometimes it rings and sometimes it doesn't. I've checked all of my settings (even the silent mode), and I cannot figure out why only a portion of my incoming calls actually ring.. THE POSITIVES: The refurbished guarantee has held true in some regard. I have 82% battery health (renewed guarantees 80% or more) and it does seem to retain it's charge very well. The cosmetic blemishes are at a minimum, and I would say that it is in excellent condition insofar as looks are concerned.. ...I just cannot get past the fact that this phone already has software issues mere days into ownership. I may have to deduct another star and/or exchange this item for one that works properly.",3.0 out of 5 stars,https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-SE-128GB-Red/dp/B088NKTHQW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"Apple iPhone SE (2nd Generation), US Version, 128GB, Red - Unlocked (Renewed)"

" August 3, 2022",Reviewed in the United States ,kyle robert davis,"First one had an issue, but second one worked fine.","I ordered the iPhone 12 and not a scratch on it. I checked out all the lenses, flash, speakers and everything else, but I forgot to make a phone call because I had to go to att and get a new sim since I was transferring from a 6s +. The headphone speaker was messed up as I found out like 9 days later when I could only talk on speaker during calls. Battery health was at 82% but it EASILY lasts a full day plus, even with heavy use.. I ordered a new one before I sent the first one back and there were a few scratches on the top right, but my case covers it up now. Phone had no issues besides a little dust/dirt in the speaker and mic holes, but you can use a wooden toothpicks to gently clean those out. Got everything switched over and sent the other phone back. Battery health on this one was 88%.. Overall, purchase was great - just make sure to double-check everything before the 90 days is up so you can replace it if needed. It feels better in my hand with a case and I added a glass screen protector.. CHECKLIST: Proximity sensor while on a call, open up a white board website and make sure the whole screen functions correctly by coloring every inch, ear speaker and bottom speaker, mic, connectivity to your phone service and to your wireless, silent/sound rocker on the left side halfway up, make sure all the buttons press in cleanly and make sure there, check the flash by using flashlight or taking photos and be sure to shine a light on the camera lenses to make sure there are no scratches.

" February 3, 2022",Reviewed in the United States ,TheScoskopp,"Great experience, Read for a honest unbiased  however just a few things people should know","I declined to leave a unboxing video & picture on this one as its the 2nd device I've bought from this store/seller in a month, technically 3 in total from one of their affiliates. So , I'll start with delivery & packaging , in my profession ( CyberSec/OSINT ) this is very important detail. , it will typically tell the rest of your experience. They did great with shipping times, the got it to me early which is always welcomed and as promised came with a very generic charging block & cable and the device that's about it and it all works great!. I will also say their. after market packaging they used was actually very professional and looked great, sealed with care . There was some paperwork on the side I highly suggest reading as its about your warranty and thus is important. Remember you pay for what you get, especially with Iphones. I use Android and IOS in business, I bought a brand new 2021 NEW flagship android device for $320 less than this product but what I paid extra for was that Amazon renewed guarantee which not only promises your device to come with certain prerequisites like over 90% battery life etc BUT it comes with a one year warranty as well as a great return policy which is also a year. I saw alot of mixed reviews , and the details is where you need to look . This company/store did a great job. With its presentation, Now I'm not going to go to deep I go i to a deep review on the device as a iphone is a iphone, is a iphone. I have owned every model ,this was a replacement for me aside from business use. This would have been 5 stars all around given the check star system Amazon has in place However, for example the battery I gave 4 stars, it did come with 90% battery in its bank but like most Iphones unless it's a new battery and has been conditioned ( charged ) properly the battery life is not great on any pro model unless it's the max versions but it will do most great and as expected. The forest green was a color I loved and was out of stock when I bought it new so that was a nice addition vs the green iphone 12 pro I have which a total different shade of green. So I bought a bundle , a recommended case and some tempered glass screen protectors, I will say as they are sufficient, I made a common mistake as I do like to pay for convienance these bundles are not always the most cost effective route. Do yourself a favor & look around, so my total was about $730 , the phone itself was priced decent enough but remember that tax is going go be a least $50 added to the device. The phone came 100% Factory Unlocked as advertised and in great shape , the only blemish which I wasn't heartbroken about However for that kind of money and knowing how inexpensive it is to fix the glass as I've done it many of times, there was a decent scratch at the top near the top speaker HOWEVER, I am a tad OCD about things like that especially when spending that kind of money and having actually bought 3 devices Factory Unlocked I have a high standard. I think most people wont take a 2nd look at it. Just a side note, the resell and value system of used Iphones especially are still very off in 2022 considering for another $150 I could've just bought the iPhone 13 NEW. That said, that has nothing to do with this seller or store just a observation as my business is in all tech. At the end of the day,I can o my fairly go off of what I git & my experience. I am highly impressed and happy with this purchase. This store/seller took great care in its delivery time, its great packaging, everything came as advertised and product for all Intensive purposes is basically NEW. After 3 devices both IOS & Android , I would not hesitate to do business with this company again. Don't second guess these guys , in reality this was a 5 star sale . They did great business and as I said I was willing to pay more as yes you can find this de ice cheaper all day BUT you are gambling , when it co es to stuff like this I can't stress enough you get what you pay for. The device was perfect, again great presentation, Factory unlocked,ive tested it on over 20 GSM carriers thus far and I paid for a great product but a peace of mind for a full year , it has a great warranty, and I have no plans of a return but that option is there if you want it . They did great, I am happy and would buy again!",4.0 out of 5 stars,https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-64GB-Midnight-Green/dp/B07ZQRMWVB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"Apple iPhone 11 Pro, 64GB, Midnight Green - Unlocked (Renewed)"

Ordered this phone as a cost effective alternative to the 13 and/or 14 as the features and ""Bells and Whistles"". Was forced to update my previous device as the iPhone 7 no longer supports iOS 16 :-(. Thoughts on this order/process:. Pros:. -Looks brand new. -Faster than my iPhone 7 ;-). -Camera is awesome. -Battery Life (con below) was received at 98%!. -Fast, seamless setup.. -Unlocked and Not T-Mobile (which I originally ordered). -Came with charger cord/adapter. -Fast delivery. -Apple certified parts validated in settings (screen, etc.). Cons:. -Battery life went to 97% after one week of use?! That makes me very nervous.. -There were some dings I found on the outer edge of the phone in 4 places-No biggie as there's a cover on it now.. -Wish there was an option for T-mobile vs. Unlocked. Apparently, there are multiple sellers on this product and even though I chose ""T-mobile"" I received ""Unlocked"" which is fine, but I paid more for the T-mobile vs. another seller that was a cheaper ""Unlocked"" option..

Battery health shows 88 percent. Works flawlessly, and no problem updating to iOS 16.1.1. Why people continue to get conned into signing 2 and 3 year agreements to finance a phone is beyond me. Having an UNLOCKED phone like this iPhone X is a great way to afford much better deals from MVNOs like Mint, Visible, etc without being handcuffed to a carrier for years and the freedom to port out if service degrades or they start playing games with the bill.. The X is still supported by Apple, is the right size, and plenty of speed for what most people do with a phone. I bought the 256GB model for $250. You really can't go wrong with that. A high quality 20 watt charger and LONG (much longer than what came with the phone) Lightning cable was also included.. Phones like this have plenty of life left in them and keep us free from the scams that carrier financing are without draining our bank accounts. It's also nice to not have all the carrier bloatware shoved down your throat (more a problem with Android than iOS).",5.0 out of 5 stars,https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-256GB-Space-Gray/dp/B081TMCS8H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"Apple iPhone X, US Version, 256GB, Space Gray - Unlocked (Renewed)"

" November 28, 2022",Reviewed in the United States ,Frank Sinatra,Battery longevity is in question.,"I bought this phone for work related use. I opted to go the refurbished route given my use case. After looking through my many options and deciding IOS is best for my business use I went ahead and pulled the trigger on this amazon refurbished Iphone XS. I knew what I was going into and fully expected this phone to have some minor blemishes and at least 80% battery.. Upon arrival, I was satisfied with the phone despite the phone having much more extensive screen wear than expected AND a pretty poor excuse for a screen protector meant to cover up the screen wear. It is however an old model, refurbished phone, so that is to be expected.. Here is the massive flub. The battery capacity.. Upon receiving the iphone I promptly turned it on and tested the device, including the battery life. 91%. Given they guarantee 80% I thought I got really lucky and hit the refurbished jackpot.. Well, fast forward not even a week and I decided to check the battery life again. 82%????. Now I am no engineer, but 9% battery degradation in less than a week sounds excessive.. I figured its still above 80%(what was advertised) so I still got the product I payed for. I can live with a shorter battery life.. Fast forward 7 more months of minimal use. The phone is on daily with very limited screen time. Work related texts and calls. Occasionally audible, or spotify use. Monitored all my charging to prevent over charging.. Now my battery health is at 60%.. Im not sure what rate of degradation is normal but given my use case mine seems to have died unreasonably quickly. I bought this as a cheaper alternative to a new iphone but 300 is by no means cheap and for a device that is quickly dying 8 months later.. I am always a bit nervous buying refurbished tech, especially from Amazon.. Buying refurbished is a flip of a coin and you may get luckier than me but this left a sour taste in my mouth and left me feeling inclined to leave this review as a disclaimer.. In the future I will either buy new, or go the ebay refurbished route given their refurbs tend to be a bit cheaper and come with a 1 year warranty on all ebay certified refurbished tech.. Good luck to all those in the market. If you decide to go this route, I hope you get luckier than I did.",3.0 out of 5 stars,https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-Fully-Unlocked-256/dp/B07TJBCC7H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"Apple iPhone XS, US Version, 256GB, Space Gray - Unlocked (Renewed)"

" December 1, 2022",Reviewed in the United States ,Mackenzie,Good bang for your buck!,"I was skeptical about purchasing a refurbished phone from Amazon; I normally go with BestBuy. But I broke my phone right before Thanksgiving and had very limited options -- this one was the best value for what I was looking for.. Delivery came exactly on time (5 days with the holiday). The phone was admittedly a little dirty - some fingerprints on the edges, the speaker was dusty - but that was an easy fix. Was it annoying to have to clean it? Yeah, they should come already cleaned (that's why it gets 4 stars) but -- hey, I needed this phone.. There are like two barely visible scratches on the screen; you can't even see them from arm's distance (holding your phone at normal length). You can only see them if you're looking for them and they're smaller than a cat hair. I'm totally happy with that.. Phone is in great condition, started up fine, everything works. I just popped my SIM card in from my old phone and didn't have a single minute of disrupted phone service; everything transferred over fine.

" July 28, 2022",Reviewed in the United States ,Groovdafied,"Had issues, but was taken care of by their support with a bonus! Super quick resolution.","Quick Note: The test report screenshot shows three failed items. That's only due to me not having headphones to test at the time as well as the SIM card. I've a screenshot of speed test working on T-Mobile network LTE. So it works fine.. Initially I ordered an iPhone 11 Pro Max for my mother, 64GB version. Unfortunately, the ear piece wasn't working and contacted the seller via Amazon message center. I had to send the phone back in order to complete the replacement.. They provided the 2-day shipping label (sent out on Saturday, arrived there Monday). They kept in pretty close contact with me and that was good. They shipped Tuesday and received Thursday morning. So there's very little delay in getting the replacement.. Diagnostics checked out (see screenshots). The Earpiece tests that failed were due to me not having a headphone to try it on at the time. But I'm assuming it works and will edit if that changes.. The condition of the phone is near new! No blemishes on the body and screen looks really clean. There was very minute permanent lines in the screen that looked like smudges, but they with the sceen on, you don't notice it at all. PLUS they gave us a couple acrylic screen protectors, so that was a major plus!. The BONUS (at least for me)!. It turned out to be a blessing in disguise for me, because they ended up upgrading me to the 256GB model free (initially 64GB model). My mom didn't understand what that meant, and I pretty much explained that she can download apps and take photos to her hearts desire LOL.. It's a phone for mom, and she's coming from a Samsung A21 phone that had performance issues and wifi problems. Kept saying there's no internet and reboots in safemode. I wanted simplicity with Face-ID (which also works) that pretty much takes care of itself, and iOS delivers on that.. So ya, experienced issues. All devices will have a defect one way or the other (or none). You just need to contact their support and work with them before submitting your review. It annoys me when someone says ""It's defective"" with no resolution comments of what they ended up doing..

" June 8, 2021",Reviewed in the United States ,Mike Lambert,Shipping of the 11 Pro Max 512 GB midnight Green refurbished IPhone,"Okay Reviewers I ordered this IPhone 11 Pro Max off of my sons prime account.. This is one bad ass phone! And I got a great deal from this amazing company! Shipping was on point! And this phone OMG perfect! Like it came from Apple! If I didn‚Äôt know it was refurbished? I would have thought it was never touched! That‚Äôs how perfect it is! I felt like a child at Christmas! Stoked! So, definitely would and will buy from this company again! Thank you for your loyalty to your customers! Super excited! Placed it in a case as soon as I looked at it .. Okay about the iPhone 11 Pro Max .. outside of it‚Äôs beauty . Wish I could take a picture of it , but i can‚Äôt . I‚Äôm on it... the 11 is holding its value for great reasons .. it really is a bad ass phone !! And the 12‚Äôs are nice but the 11‚Äôs sit right next to those 12‚Äôs ! But cheaper in price but the quality is all the same!. The pictures are amazing!!! ( FYI My son has the 12 My sister 12 pro and brother in law has 12 pro Max ) so pictures are not so noticeably different.. cause this 11 pro Max takes great photos also and the battery life is awesome ! 24 hrs no charge and still had life left! I have charged it with the cord charging ( it came with a good charging cord not junk) and I also have charged it with the magnetic cordless charging.. about the same.. I have not done the face recognition as of yet.. I use a passcode.. I do miss the finger / thumb recognition button but from what I see with my son ? Face recognition is prob just as fast or faster?. The speakers on this is loud! Love it!. Now yes this is a bigger device it is a 6.5 in screen but it‚Äôs not bulky at all ! The phone is slender not heavy but a case did help tremendously holding it cause it‚Äôs so thin.. haha i dont know how to explain that one but I Dont know to drop it haha so a case helps to grip it .. if that makes sense ? Lol. But with the cheaper price tag ? I was able to get the highest GB and still save a few hundred‚Äô dollars!. I did my research cause I was looking at this phone for a while and then was gearing for the 12 pro Max for it has 3 or 4 better features. But After comparing and deep research? What was being said is true! The 11‚Äôs are amazing phones! And unless your a Photographer? You won‚Äôt see a inkling of a difference with the camera or video.. the processor in the 11‚Äôs are also fast and made right! Apple surly did a great job with the 11‚Äôs !!! So again for what you get and with that price tag ? You can‚Äôt go wrong with the Iphome 11 pro Max! I‚Äôm freaking happy I got one heck of a deal ! I love the look ,the quality, how fast it responds, the pictures, the battery life, the features, and the company that I bought it from! Hope this helps with someone‚Äôs research and decision making!",5.0 out of 5 stars,https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-64GB-Space-Gray/dp/B07ZQSQSBM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, 64GB, Space Gray - Unlocked (Renewed)"

" August 27, 2022",Reviewed in the United States ,Hannah,UPDATED,Worked great for 3 days and then started messing up. I returned for a refund and it‚Äôs been NOTHING but problems trying to get my money back. I‚Äôve gotten the run around told several different story‚Äôs! I was told I would have my refund back by the 27th here is it the 29th and still haven‚Äôt seen the refund. When I try to find out about it all I get is rude agents that are hateful as all get out with no information. There is no problem giving your money but sure is hard to get it back! It‚Äôs a hit or miss better off saving for a new one! It‚Äôs very aggravating and a headache it‚Äôs not $20 or something it‚Äôs almost $600. They tell you 2 weeks for your refund but when the 2 weeks come they turn around and say longer than 2 weeks. If you do purchase good luck hopefully you‚Äôre experience is better!. I was kinda nervous to buy this as the last phone I got (FROM ANOTHER SELLER) I had problems from the beginning even the 2nd phone they had sent me. But this by far is an amazing purchase! If I didn‚Äôt know it was ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù I‚Äôd swear it was brand new off the shelf! Also came with 100% battery life! Got it yesterday at 8:00am and it‚Äôs now 4:23pm the next day and it‚Äôs still yet to go dead I‚Äôve not even had to charge it. It did come completely dead but that‚Äôs not a big deal I guess. I‚Äôve used it a lot so battery is by far AMAZING! That‚Äôs a big plus for me the speakers are amazing and very loud.

" September 10, 2022",Reviewed in the United States ,A.J.,"Coming from android, apple IOS is a big disappointment, though it does do some things well.","I could write so much, but it all boils down to apple IOS being about 5-7 years behind developement of android. The ability to customize something as basic as the keyboard (to the effective degree you can in android) is frustratingly absent, and you are stuck with the most basic of keyboards that require you to have to flip through different keyboard screens just to get to common things like a questionmark.. Phone specific, the cameras and what not are good, but the screen colors are a tad washed out/pale, and there really isn't a fix for it.. All and all, my next phone won't be an iphone, apple IOS is just too archaic and undeveloped compared to android, but the phone is decent enough that I'll hang on to it for a year or so before upgrading, which is something I don't usually do, given my last phone was a Note 9 that I used for 4 years.

" November 11, 2022",Reviewed in the United States ,Jaleel Middleton,BUY THIS PHONE! TREAT YOURSELF!,"I typically NEVER leave a review but I felt like it was VERY NECESSARY to do so. Time & time again.. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre online & wanting to treat yourself to something (a gift) until you click the reviews & your expectations are met with complaints by individuals who are (quite frankly) overly critical! I get it.. you are spending money on something.. but ruining someone‚Äôs experience/expectations because ‚Äúthe up button doesn‚Äôt CLICK with the appropriate sound‚Äù is ridiculous! I just had to get THAT out of the way.. forgive my rant... As for this product itself.. as the title reads... BUY THIS PHONE! I‚Äôm not sure if I just got extremely lucky or not but.. this phones LOOKS & PERFORMS like BRAND NEW! Seriously! Perhaps it was whoever owned this particular phone prior but.. I hit the jackpot! No scratches on the screen.. no scratches on ANY glass surface (to which this phone is made mostly of glass it seems).. I originally had the iPhone XR & was looking for a phone with a larger screen. As terrible as it sounds, I never knew the iPhone XS MAX existed. I came across by accident. To me.. this is basically the XR‚Äôs upgrade. Larger screen & literally does everything just like the XR. The only exception is the PHENOMENAL OLED presentation over the LED of the XR. Order yourself a case & screen protector ahead of purchasing this device but you WILL NOT regret it!

" May 23, 2022",Reviewed in the United States ,Merritt Wiley,Disappointing - it feels like I was harmed by an old friend,"Purchasing a renewed cell phone involves 4 critical (and inseparable) buying decision components. Each component is as important as the hardware itself, and all 4 components make-up the Buyer‚Äôs final buying decision and subsequent purchase experience:. 1) The Hardware. 2) The Warranty and Related Seller Assurances. 3) The Customer Service (pre & post purchase). 4) Overall value of the purchase. Unlike a new, factory-fresh telephone; a renewed telephone has a greater risk of failure, long-term usability issues and cosmetic imperfections. The obvious reason for this is a phone‚Äôs unknown history of use, maintenance/care, and ultimate reconditioning processes.. The following will describe, in as much objective detail as is possible, my recent purchase of an iPhone XS Max from the Amazon Renewed Premium program. I will briefly describe myself, as an Amazon Buyer, to add helpful context. BUYER. To date, I have made 697 purchases with Amazon across 3 accounts in the US, Mexico and UK. My return ratio is 2.3%. Purchases mainly include high-end electronics (computers, phones, printers, networking gear, headphones, etc.) and unique household items. I am a Prime member who maintains and gifts book related subscriptions, and regularly gift Amazon Echo devices to family members. In short, our household(s) use Amazon frequently and Amazon has become ‚Äúa family friend‚Äù that we have learned to rely on.. 1 - Hardware. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BFMH5GZ?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details . iPhone XS Max ‚Äì The Apple flagship of late 2018. The packaging was a 9‚Äùx 5‚Äù x2‚Äù white Amazon box with the phone and a charging cable. The white box was placed in 12‚Äô x 10‚Äô x 5‚Äù with 3 small bubbles. The white box ‚Äúrattled around‚Äù in the outer packaging.. The exterior of the phone was clean and scratch-free. The screen was protected with a sheet of soft plastic.. Battery Health = 88%. Unlocked = Fully. iOS received = 14. iOS updated to 15.5.. The configuration of the phone was a ‚Äúquirky‚Äù and the screen flickered from time-to-time. Because of this, I called Apple Support (I have an account) to help evaluate the phone and assist with the configuration and pairing to my existing Apple accounts. The TSR connected with the iPhone XS Max and diagnosed that there were issues with the display module and (possibly) the antenna. The inability of the phone to recognize most nearby Bluetooth devices was thought to be the caused by the antenna issue. The Apple TSR suggested I return the phone. At this point, I had the phone for approximately 6 hours.. Disappointed (I needed the phone and had already purchased another $65 of accessories), I agreed with the Apple TSR and she helped me annotate the precise reasons for her diagnosis. My next step was to contact Amazon, for the promised Premium Support, to describe the issues.. 2 - Warranty and Related Seller Assurances. I contacted the main Amazon Prime number and described the issues (At this point, I was in possession of the phone for less than 20 hours). I was transferred to another department that handled Amazon Renewed Premium matters.. Rep 1 ‚Äì after describing the issues to the Rep and the Apple diagnosis, the Rep agreed with the Apple TSR and suggested I return the phone. I opted to have the purchase price refunded to me (to have some time to consider my next purchase options and availability). The Amazon Renewed Premium Rep told me it could take up to 180 days for a refund! I asked to speak with a Supervisor.. Supervisor ‚Äì agreed the phone should be returned and stated that the return policy allowed up to 180 days but said that 25 days after they received the unit was more normal. She also stated that I had to pay for the shipping from Mexico back to the US (which has not been not normal for amazon.com returns from Mexico since 2015). Is this a new ‚Äústandard return policy‚Äù? Why was it not clearly described on the website, they knew where it was going?. I paid extra for the Amazon Renewed Premium phone and the assurances that I would be fully satisfied. When I made the purchase, that assurance gave me a ‚Äúwarm fuzzy feeling‚Äù and the confidence to complete the purchase of the phone.. 3 - Customer Service (pre & post purchase). Pre-Purchase: Went smoothly. I read all of the materials, decided on the higher costs Amazon Renewed Premium version and paid for it. The order was placed on 11 May and it was received at my home in Cuernavaca, Mexico on 15 May. I paid USD 525.70 ($429.00 ‚Äì phone, $8.24 ‚Äì shipping & handling and $88.46 for the import fees deposit). Please note the cost of shipping.. Post-Purchase: Not a good experience. Details can be provided, upon request. To make a long story short, the refund and return process was an unexpected shock. The hardware/phone is defective and I promptly reported it. There was no reason for the sub-par treatment of the return. I offered to pay for the return but asked Amazon to arrange it through their low-cost contract rates ‚Äì they refused. My cost for the return (via DHL) would be USD 95.35 and a 3-hour round trip drive to the nearest DHL office. Since 2015, I have not been asked to pay for the return of a defective device. Even DHL (the contract RMA carrier for Amazon) was surprised that I had to pay, and they handle Amazon returns every day.. 4 ‚Äì Overall Value of the iPhone Purchase. I securely packed the iPhone XS Max to assure it would arrive safely, and sent it via DHL at a cost of USD 95.35. That now brings the cost of this phone to $621.05.. Despite the claims that Amazon will reimburse me for shipping, I have been told by an Amazon Prime Rep that I can expect to be reimbursed no more than $20 for the return. If true, I will take at least a $73.35 loss on this purchase.. I will not purchase another phone until I have received the full refund for this one. That means I will be without a phone for up to 180 days.. Buying a renewed phone has not been the experience I was hoping for. The hardware was defective and the warranty/assurances/services I believed I was getting when buying from Amazon Renewed Premium did not materialize.. Summary Rating. 1 Star ‚Äì Hardware (iPhone XS Max) ‚Äì defective. 1 Star ‚Äì Warranty and Relate Seller Assurances. 1 Star ‚Äì Customer Service. 1 Star ‚Äì Overall Value. Again, when buying a renewed product, it is impossible to detach the actual product (hardware) from the other components of the purchase. It is simply the nature of selling and buying renewed products.",1.0 out of 5 stars,https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-Max-64GB-Gold/dp/B08BFMH5GZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"Apple iPhone XS Max, 64GB, Gold - Unlocked (Renewed Premium)"

There was a two week of ‚Äúusing old junk phone, a 7 that has been put through the ringer but still works. This 12 mini has no scratches, touch screen is the best I‚Äôve ever had. The one feature I missed the most. True Tone. It‚Äôs back and I‚Äôm never changing another battery again. Apple does it for &. $69 the only down fall, if you want to call it one is the battery life is at %84 I‚Äôm more than happy to hand over $69 plus tax to apple for a new battery. It also came with a new cord and charging block. I also like to see mi-fi sticker on both. Gave me peace of mind at see those tags. I will always look to Amazon renewed apple products in the future. Here‚Äôs one random piece of advise. If you leave your phone at home on accident. Don‚Äôt panic. It will be there when you get home. ‚òÆÔ∏è",5.0 out of 5 stars,https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-12-Mini-64GB/dp/B08PNN2SKF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"Apple iPhone 12 Mini, 64GB, Blue - Unlocked (Renewed)"
" November 29, 2022",Reviewed in the United States ,Jessica Pierce,Experience on my return and refund,"My daughter wanted a new iPhone and I thought I would get an upgraded iPhone from her current one. I thought she had a mini....I ordered an ""acceptable"" condition device. The phone was in actually really nice condition even for acceptable. I few little scratches on the corners that would be covered up with a case anyway. Very pleased with the phone. Turned it on, got it setup. And when I went to get some info from my daughter's original iPhone I realized she does NOT have a mini and apparently getting a smaller iPhone was not what she was hoping for.. Sooo....I had to return the phone. This seller refunded my account as soon as it was returned to their warehouse. I was very pleased with the product being above and beyond what I expected and the return/refund process was exceptional!",5.0 out of 5 stars,https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-12-Mini-64GB/dp/B08PNN2SKF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,"Apple iPhone 12 Mini, 64GB, Blue - Unlocked (Renewed)"
